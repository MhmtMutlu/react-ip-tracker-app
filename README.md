## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - For styles
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Type Safety JS
- [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) - Map Library
- [IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/docs) - IP Geolocation API
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have made practices about TypeScript, SCSS, ReactJS and ContextAPI. Also, that was the first experience about using maps for me. That's why, I have learned using maps, setting positions and recenter map when positions change.

### Continued development

I would like to learn Next.js and try to code new project with it.

### Useful resources

- [ReactJS Documents](https://reactjs.org/) - This documents helped me to create Contexts.
- [SCSS Documents](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - This is an amazing article which helped me SCSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [React Leaflet Documents](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) - This is very usefull library if you need to use map in your projects.
